# TypeScript Node Executable Example

Example repo to show how to convert a .ts file with dependencies into a single executable

To create a single executable, run the following command:

MacOS
```bash
./build.macos.sh
```

Windows
```powershell
pwsh -Command ./build.windows.bat
```

Linux
```bash
./build.linux.sh
```

This will create a single executable file in the `dist` folder. You can run this file directly.
